    Daily and Sports Activities Data Set

    Brief Description of the Dataset:
    ---------------------------------
    Each of the 19 activities is performed by eight subjects (4 female, 4 male, between the ages 20 and 30) for 5 minutes.
    Total signal duration is 5 minutes for each activity of each subject.
    The subjects are asked to perform the activities in their own style and were not restricted on how the activities should be performed. 
    For this reason, there are inter-subject variations in the speeds and amplitudes of some activities.
	
    The activities are performed at the Bilkent University Sports Hall, in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Building, and in a flat outdoor area on campus. 
    Sensor units are calibrated to acquire data at 25 Hz sampling frequency. 
    The 5-min signals are divided into 5-sec segments so that 480(=60x8) signal segments are obtained for each activity.
