    UTD Multimodal Human Action Dataset (UTD-MHAD)

    BASIC INFO ABOUT THE DATA:
    ---------------------------------

    The dataset contains 27 actions performed by 8 subjects (4 females and 4 males).

    Our UTD-MHAD dataset consists of 27 different actions: 
        (1) right arm swipe to the left, 
        (2) right arm swipe to the right, 
        (3) right hand wave, (4) two hand front clap, 
        (5) right arm throw, (6) cross arms in the chest, 
        (7) basketball shoot, (8) right hand draw x, 
        (9) right hand draw circle (clockwise), 
        (10) right hand draw circle (counter clockwise), 
        (11) draw triangle, (12) bowling (right hand), 
        (13) front boxing, (14) baseball swing from right, 
        (15) tennis right hand forehand swing, (16) arm curl (two arms), 
        (17) tennis serve, (18) two hand push, (19) right hand knock on door, 
        (20) right hand catch an object, (21) right hand pick up and throw, 
        (22) jogging in place, (23) walking in place, (24) sit to stand, 
        (25) stand to sit, (26) forward lunge (left foot forward), 
        (27) squat (two arms stretch out).
    The inertial sensor was worn on the subject's right wrist or the right thigh (see the figure below) 
    depending on whether the action was mostly an arm or a leg type of action. 
    Specifically, for actions 1 through 21, the inertial sensor was placed on the subject's right wrist; 
    for actions 22 through 27, the inertial sensor was placed on the subject's right thigh.

    The sampling rate of this wearable inertial sensor is 50 Hz. 
    The measuring range of the wearable inertial sensor is ±8g for acceleration and ±1000 degrees/second for rotation.
